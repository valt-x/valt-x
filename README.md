      <h3>📍 The Work</h3>
      <br>
      <strong>Current Focus</strong>
      <br>
      Building <strong>NLM</strong>. Deep diving into Distributed Systems and Functional Programming. I am exploring how Elixir and OTP can handle high-concurrency workloads better than traditional stacks.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The Tech Radar</strong>
      <br>
      <code>Adopting</code> Elixir, Phoenix, OTP
      <br>

      <h3>🧠 The Mindset</h3>
      <br>
      <strong>Philosophy</strong>
      <br>
      I prefer systems that heal themselves over systems that are just "fast."
      <br><br>
      <strong>Ask Me About</strong>
      <br>
      Questions that start with "How do we scale..." or "Why is the GPU acting weird?"
      <br><br>
      <strong>Offline</strong>
      <br>
      Reading papers, Chennai traffic survival, and dark coffee.
