# valt-x

Personal development workspace.

Current work includes:
- systems experiments in Nim
- learning Elixir / OTP
- small tools in Python
- Linux-based development

Builds and experiments run on self-managed infrastructure
(including RackGenius machines).

Most things here started because something annoyed me.

Code is iterative and may change without notice.
